I come from Esslingen and I decided to become a frontend developer because I have always been fascinated by the world of websites.\n\nSix months ago, I made the decision to further my education through the Developer Academy.\n\nI am fascinated by how one can create impressive and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and modern web technologies. I find it particularly exciting to transform visual ideas into functional interfaces that users can intuitively experience.",
